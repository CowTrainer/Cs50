1.  stidint.h defines a set of interger types with width's of a specific amount of bits
2.  The point is that it makes clear to people exactly how many bits you intend to use
3.  BYTE = 1 Byte, DWORD = 4 Bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD=4 Bytes
4.  The two first bytes of any BMP file is the letter B and the letter M in ASCII
5.  BfSize is the total amount of bytes in the file and BiSize is the number of bytes in the info header
6.  If biHeight is negative the bitmap is a Top Down DIB(Meaning the top row of the bitmap is the first row) and its origin is in the top left corner
7.  BiBItCount defines BITMAPINFOHEADER's bits per pixel
8.  For line 24 the input file could not exist or not be openable and for line 32 it could not be able to create and open the output file
9.  It is because we are reading only 1 struct.If we were reading 5 it would be 5 instead of 1
10. It assigns padding to a value of 1
11. fseek changes the position of a pointer in a file depending on the offset and the origin(SEEK_SET,SEEK_CUR,SEEK_END) 
12. SEEK_CUR is the current postion of the file pointer
